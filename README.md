# shitrental-rating-analysis
This is my first project on github; it is a project from data science course in my master degree.

Here I analyse shitrental.csv dataset, which is a file contains customer review from shitrental.com

Aim of analysis is to see what are the main drivers of customer rating score (variable 'score')
